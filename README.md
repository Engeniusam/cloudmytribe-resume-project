# Engeniusam Resume - Cloud Resume Challenge

## Introduction

This project is part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, which aims to host a static website on AWS using services such as Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon Certificate Manager. The challenge involves deploying a simple resume website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and ensuring it is accessible, secure, and performs well globally.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### MILESTONE 1 -> Deploying with the AWS Console ðŸš€

#### Review the Challenge Requirements

- **Outcome**: Gained a clear understanding of the objectives and deliverables.

#### Explore AWS Documentation
- **Action**: Explored AWS documentation for Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, Route 53, IAM, and Amazon Certificate Manager.
- **Outcome**: Acquired knowledge of the services, including best practices and configurations.

#### Build Your Architecture Diagram
- **Action**: Designed an architecture diagram using Lucidchart.
- **Components Included**: S3 bucket for static website hosting, CloudFront distribution for CDN, Route 53 for DNS management, and IAM roles/policies for access management.
- **Outcome**: Created a comprehensive architecture diagram representing the infrastructure.

### Challenges Faced

- Encountered issues with SSL/TLS certificate validation when configuring Amazon CloudFront. Resolved by carefully following Amazon Certificate Manager documentation to correctly associate the certificate with the CloudFront distribution.
- Experienced challenges creating a new cloudfront resource in my AWS account. Resolved it by creating an EC2 instance and afterwards the AWS Support team which I had also sent a ticket to verify my account, verified it successfully

### Key Takeaways

- Learned the importance of securing websites with HTTPS and the role of CDN in reducing latency.
- Gained hands-on experience with AWS services, including S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and IAM.

### Resources

- AWS Documentation
- Lucidchart for architecture diagrams
- AWS tutorials on YouTube

## Outcome

Successfully deployed and secured a static resume website on AWS, making it accessible globally with minimal latency. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also provided valuable experience in using AWS services for web hosting.
